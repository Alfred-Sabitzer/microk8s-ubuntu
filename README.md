# Setup a Secure manageable Kubernetes

Aim is to be safe as possible, with the use of microk8s https://microk8s.io/ and the recommendations of CNCF https://www.cncf.io/ 
Besides this we will implement some homegrown examples

## Supported Kubernetes versions

Current version is

````bash
alfred@k8s:~$ snap info microk8s | grep -i installed
installed:               v1.32.3             (7964) 172MB classic

````
